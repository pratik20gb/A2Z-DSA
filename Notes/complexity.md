##  the rate at which the time taken increase with reference to the input size is know as time complexity .

- TC - big oh notation - O(time taken)
- time complexity to be computed in terms of worst case scenarios
- avoid constants
- avoid lower values


big oh - worst case [upper bound]
theta  - average case
omega - best case [lowest bound]

space complexity - Memory space
                - big oh notation 
- Auxiliary space + input space = space complexity
- aux - the space that u take to solve the problem
- input - the space that u take to store the input 
### never temper with the data or inputs given 
c = a+b
here space complexity will be O(3)
